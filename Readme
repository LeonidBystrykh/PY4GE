Here is the place for the supplementary information for the manuscript submitted to F1000.
It contains three examples of scripts for detection of differentially expressing genes. I use one data file as an example.
Do not consider those scripts as the best and final protocol for all possible cases. To the contrary, this is just an illustration 
to the discussed subject what is currently possible in this field using python programming language.
If you have some creative thoughts or productive suggestions you can contact me via e-mail: l.bystrykh@umcg.nl or l.bystrykh@rug.nl
Thanks,
Leonid
